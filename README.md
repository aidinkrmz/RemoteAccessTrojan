# RemoteAccessTrojan
This Remote Access Trojan written by Python language 

In this Project I tried to write trojan which using this you can gain access to victim computer in lan network.
Note that you should set ip address of server and client according to your servers ip address which server is the attacker and client is victim
By the way to make it easier to run victim in him/her computer make it excutable file.

It`s better to choose kali as your server and windows 7,8,10 as your victim or client
